# Write code that simulates rolling two dice, each with 20 sides.
# Simulation 1: Use that code to estimate the probability that the sum of those two dice is exactly 36. 
# Simulation 2: Use that code to estimate the probability that the bigger value is greater than 18. Perform at least 1000 trials.
